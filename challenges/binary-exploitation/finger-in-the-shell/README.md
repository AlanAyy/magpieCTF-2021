## Description
I found this old program in my grandfather's computer. I think a worm lived here once?

## Hints
1. Find mprotect call
2. Use both buffers to spawn a shell

## Solution
The solution involves a bit of ROP, buffer overflow and shellcode injection. 

1. Figure out what buffers are exploitable with some fuzz testing
2. Using a decompiler, find the call the mprotect
3. Inject shellcode in log buffer
4. Overflow line buffer and redirect return address to mprotect followed by log buffer

For a detailed solution, see exploit.py in source/
