## Description
Obi-Wan extracted this vulnerable program from the Deathstar. Apparently, if you can exploit the local binary, you can hack the remote program inside the Deathstar!

## Hints
1. The program needs to be run twice. 
2. Leak the address of a function

## Solution
The solution for this challenge requires more advanced knowledge of ROP. First, a libc address needs to be leaked in the program. Then, on the second run of the program, the full exploit can be executed once the ASLR offsets have been exposed. 

1. Find minimum bytes to segfault
2. Using the provided libc, leak an address within the program
3. Within the same rop chain the address was leaked, run the program again (don't let it exit) by placing the address of main at the end of the first chain.
4. Update the libc with the leaked offset you found.
5. Find system and binsh within the program and build final rop chain payload
