## Description
Dracula left his terminal open. It's password protected but he's not very good at programming. He really should stick to evil magic...

## Hints
No hints. Everything needed is given in print statements.

## Solution
Solution is to overwrite the 9 byte password. The real obstacle is giving gets a null byte right after the first password so that strcmp will not compare the entire 256 byte buffer. Instead, it will stop at the 10th byte, the null byte. 

For a detailed solution, see exploit.py in solve/
