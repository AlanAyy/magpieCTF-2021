## Description
I wrote a program that prints out the lyrics to my favourite song but I lost the source code. Can you make it work with just the binary?

## Hints
1. Use ROP chains!
2. Find ROP gadgets!

## Solution
Simple but long rop chain. The goal is to piece together the lyrics of Eurythmics' "Sweet Dreams" song which will build the string "/bin/sh" to be executed using "system()". This is done using rop gadgets and return oriented programming. See solve script for detailed solution. 

1. Find minimum bytes to segfault program
2. Figure out order of functions to spawn shell using decompiler
3. Find argument of functions using decompiler
4. Build payload using ROP gadgets. 

For a detailed solution, see exploit.py in solve/
