Hey Wren.  I made comments on the file and left it on your desk.  It doesn't quite work, I'm getting segfaults sometimes and it's not working as intended at others though I'm not 100% sure why.  I don't have the time to fix it right now.  Take a look at my comments.  Dennis.

Hi Dennis!  I took a crack at it and left it on a disk on your desk.  Let me know if I need to change anything!  Wren K.

Hi Wren.  Take a look at the at the email chain below and come see me if you need and direction.  Get this to me by Friday and I'll review it and make notes on the code and send it back to you.  Thank you, Dennis.

Put the punch cards on the backburner if you need to Dennis, or better yet just toss it to that intern we hired.  Time he did something around here for a change!  Dennis.

Alright, you're in charge Charles!  I can't get to it this week though, we're still bogged down with this punch card project and it's really dragging itself out.  Can we get more time?

It's not my decision Dennis, and it's been decided.  I don't know enough about these things to know if it'll make a difference in the program, but they want it done so we do it.  I don't think there's actually anyone out there asking for this upgrade.  In fact, I heard that someone was poking the CEO about it, saying it didn't do enough or wasn't fast enough and he got upset and ordered this.  Whatever happened, we need it done for next week.

Charles, this doesn't really make much sense.  It's not going to make that much of a difference, to the best of my knowledge numwrite was never really used or adopted!  Who is asking for this?  Also, why is management so keen on it?  numwrite was a failed project!  Why invest more time into this?!  Dennis.

Hi Dennis.  It has been decided that numwrite needs an upgrade.  We've been getting lot of complaints that it only supports long integers right now, apparently this is really slowing it down on larger inputs?  The decision has been made that we need to add some utility to it that allows the user to select regular integers to try to improve runtime when they're trying to write a lot of numbers.  Can you take care of this?  We need a prototype by next week to show management.  Thanks, Charles.
