# Description
As a kid growing up in the 80’s, little Robby was so obsessed with the Rubik’s Cube that he got the nickname “Robby the Cuber”.
To this day he still loves the puzzle and document tips and tricks for the Rubik’s Cube on his social media account and online. Can you find his secret blog of tips and tricks?

# Hints
1. Robby's favourite social media site has 353 million users as of 2020. 
2. I heard someone tell me once that Robby has a strange affinity for RGB codes. 

# Solution
1. Go to https://twitter.com/RobbyTheCuber.
2. Save the image of the rubik's cube in his first tweet. 
3. Visit a "color picker from image" website (like this one, https://www.ginifab.com/feeds/pms/color_picker_from_image.php) and note the RGB number code for the lime green side of the cube (146,232,97).
4. go to https://rubiks.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page or find it by google searching "wikicube".
5. in the website's search bar, search "14623297", (which is the RGB code for Robby's favourite rubik's cube colour, as stated on twitter) and find the blog post named "14623297".
6. The flag will be in that blog post!
