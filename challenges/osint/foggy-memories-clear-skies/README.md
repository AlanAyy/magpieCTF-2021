# Foggy Memories, Clear Skies

## Description
I don’t remember much about my first trip where I got to take an airplane. I must’ve been eight or nine, because it was definitely in 1988. And I definitely remember the drive to the Ottawa airport. As for the rest of the trip, it’s all a bit foggy. I do know that while we were there, we visited the grave of the first famous American daredevil, who jumped off Niagara Falls in the 1800s.

What airline did I fly with?

## Hints
1. Some things can be done as well as others. Such as finding the flight destination.

2. I’m sure governments keep information about old flights somewhere… right?
