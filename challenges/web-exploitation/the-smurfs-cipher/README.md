## Description
Gargamel stole the key to decrypt The Smurfs ciphertext. Now they can't get into their kingdom to view their flag. Can you help them get the right key?

## Solution
This challenge gives you a file named `cipher` and the source code used to return the flag. Your goal is to reverse engineer the source code to create, and upload, the key that will allow the flag to be returned.

1. In order to get the flag we need to ensure that `$to_check` is 0 to exploit PHP using loose comparison.
2. Create a 8 byte file that is equivalent to the the data in cipher + 0xd34db33f and upload it.
3. The flag will the be displayed.
